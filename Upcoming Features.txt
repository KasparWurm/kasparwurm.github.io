ðŸ”§ Multi-Mortar Coordination Tool Features
1. Multiple Mortar Inputs
Allow users to enter up to 4 mortar positions.

Each mortar gets a unique identifier (e.g., M1, M2, M3, M4).

Each mortar can have its own elevation and ammo type/charge (if needed).

2. Shared Target Selection
Single or multiple target positions can be set.

Optional: Assign different mortars to different targets for simultaneous fire missions.

3. Auto-Fire Synchronization
Calculate staggered fire solutions so all rounds land within a synchronized time window (based on Time of Flight).

Highlight ideal charge selection per mortar to achieve synchronicity.

4. Spread & Zone Coverage Tool
Show recommended grid dispersions for area denial (e.g., stagger grid spacing in a line or box formation).

Automatic offset calculations for mortar teams to cover a wider kill zone.

5. Visual Output (Optional but Powerful)
Generate a simple mini-map overlay (grid only) using HTML Canvas or SVG to display mortar and target positions.

6. Save / Load Fire Plans
Ability to export a coordination plan as text and copy to clipboard.

Include mortar grids, direction, range, elevation, ToF, and synchronized fire notes.
